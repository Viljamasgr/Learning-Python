# Arithmetic Operations in Python

friends = 10  # Initial number of friends

# Addition: Increment friends by 1
friends = friends + 1  # Standard addition
friends += 1  # Shortcut for incrementing by 1

# Subtraction: Decrease friends by 2
friends = friends - 2  # Standard subtraction
friends -= 2  # Shortcut for decrementing by 2

# Multiplication: Multiply the number of friends by 3
friends = friends * 3  # Standard multiplication
friends *= 3  # Shortcut for multiplication

# Division: Divide the number of friends by 2
friends = friends / 2  # Standard division (returns float)
friends /= 2  # Shortcut for division

# Exponentiation: Square the number of friends
friends = friends ** 2  # Standard exponentiation
friends **= 2  # Shortcut for exponentiation

# Modulus: Get the remainder when dividing friends by 3
remainder = friends % 3  # Returns remainder of division

# Print the final values
print("Total friends:", friends)
print("Remainder when divided by 3:", remainder)
